Welcome to this collection of machine learning projects I built as I started diving deeper into the world of **data-driven problem solving**.

Each project here reflects a hands-on milestone — where I picked a real-world challenge, explored it with curiosity, applied ML algorithms, and uncovered insights that go beyond accuracy scores.

Whether it was decoding dimensions with PCA or comparing kernel choices in SVMs — I focused on building solutions that are both **technically sound** and **easy to interpret**.
