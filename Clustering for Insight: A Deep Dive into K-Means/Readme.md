# 📌 Clustering for Insight: A Deep Dive into K-Means

This project explores **K-Means Clustering**, a powerful unsupervised learning technique used to discover hidden patterns and groupings within data without labeled outputs.

🧪 This project was completed as part of AIT 636 (Machine Learning) at George Mason University. It demonstrates how clustering can reveal structure in raw data and help in tasks such as market segmentation, anomaly detection, and exploratory analysis.

## 🧠 What is K-Means Clustering?

K-Means is an algorithm that partitions data into `K` clusters by minimizing the distance between data points and the center (centroid) of their assigned cluster. It's widely used in:

- Market segmentation
- Customer profiling
- Image compression
- Pattern recognition

---

## 🚀 What This Project Covers

- Data normalization and preprocessing
- Applying the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters
- Implementing **K-Means** using `scikit-learn`
- Visualizing clusters using 2D scatter plots
- Interpreting the meaning and distribution of clusters

---

## 📊 Results Summary

> ✅ Determined optimal clusters using the Elbow Method  
> ✅ Identified naturally occurring groupings in unlabeled data  
> ✅ Visualized clear separation between clusters using color-coded plots
