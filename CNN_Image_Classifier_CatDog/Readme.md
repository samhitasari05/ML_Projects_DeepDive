# 🐱🐶 Seeing the Difference: A CNN-Based Cat vs Dog Image Classifier

This project demonstrates the use of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images of cats and dogs.

🧪 This project applies CNNs to solve a visual classification problem using structured image data.

## 🧠 What is a CNN?

A Convolutional Neural Network is a specialized deep learning model designed for processing image data. It uses layers of filters (kernels) to automatically extract spatial features (edges, textures, patterns) and make predictions based on visual structure.

CNNs are widely used for:
- Image classification
- Object detection
- Face recognition
- Medical imaging
