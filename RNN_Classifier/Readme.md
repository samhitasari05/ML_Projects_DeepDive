# 🔁 Remembering Patterns: A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Classifier

This project implements a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** model for classification on structured or temporal data using PyTorch.

🧪 Created as part of AIT 636 (Machine Learning) at George Mason University, this project explores how RNNs can capture sequential dependencies in data — something traditional models often miss.

## 🧠 What is an RNN?

An RNN is a type of neural network designed to work with sequential or time-series data. It **remembers previous outputs** through internal memory, making it ideal for:
- Text and language modeling
- Time-series forecasting
- Audio and signal processing
- Sequential classification
